## 🚀 The Problem
Campus finance is currently **fragmented, slow, and opaque**. 
- Students struggle with splitting bills for group projects or outings.
- Club fundraising is chaotic, with no transparency on where funds go.
- Event ticketing is prone to scalping and fake tickets.
- P2P payments often involve friction and delays.

## 💡 The Solution: VIT Algo Pay
**VIT Algo Pay** is a comprehensive, **Web3-native financial ecosystem** built on the **Algorand Blockchain**. It unifies payments, bill splitting, fundraising, and ticketing into a single, futuristic SuperApp designed for the digital-native student.

- **Zero Latency:** Send ALGO or ASAs (Campus Tokens) instantly.
- **QR Scanning:** built-in camera integration for seamless in-person payments.
- **Low Fees:** < 0.001 ALGO per transaction.

#### 2. 🤝 Atomic Bill Split
- **Trustless Splitting:** Create atomic group transactions for shared expenses.
